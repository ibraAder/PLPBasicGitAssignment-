To upload your code to GitHub using Git, you can follow these general steps:
1)Create a GitHub repository: Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Note the URL of your repository (i.e https://github.com/ibraAder/PLPBasicGitAssignment-).
2)Set the remote repository: Link your local repository to the GitHub repository you just created using the command: git remote add origin <repository_url>
3)Initialize a Git repository: navigate to your project directory in the command line and initialize a Git repository using the following command: git init
4)Add your files to the repository: You can add individual files or directories to the staging area using the following command:  git add <file or directory>
5)Commit your changes: Once your files are staged, commit them to the repository with a meaningful commit message using the command: git commit -m "Your commit message here"
6)Push your changes to GitHub: Finally, push your committed changes from your local repository to the remote GitHub repository using the command: git push -u origin master
7)Verify on GitHub: Once the push is complete, visit your GitHub repository in a web browser to verify that your code has been successfully uploaded.
